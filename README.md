# AzrMicael's portfolio

This is a project I developed using as a reference the video [Build and deploy a portfolio website [Full Tutorial Course]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs), produced by KevinPowell and made available by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) on YouTube.

This project was deployed, it can be accessed through the link: [Portfolio Website](https://azrmicael.com/).

Below is a preview of the website:
